## The Rise of AI in QA

For decades, software testing has relied heavily on manual processes and scripted automation. While effective, these methods often struggled to keep pace with rapid release cycles.

### Benefits of AI-Driven Testing
- **Speed & Efficiency:** AI automation reduces regression testing time from days to hours.
- **Smarter Test Coverage:** Machine learning models identify high-risk areas of your application.
- **Early Bug Detection:** AI-driven code analysis detects potential issues before they hit production.

> "AI can’t replace human testers — it amplifies their abilities."

## Conclusion

AI is no longer a futuristic add-on — it's becoming the backbone of modern QA strategies.
